Big_Number Header

Have you ever had to use numbers longer than 400 digits, me neither
But now you can, with this header that may or may not work :)

Type:  bint;

You can: add (+), 
         substract (-), 
         multiply (*), 
         [divide (/) - still working on it],
         compare (<, >, ==, !=, >=, <=),
         use negative numbers,
         use up to 5000 digits;
